# Password Generator

This application is a random password generator based on criteria entered by the user.  When the "Generate Password" button is clicked:
  * The user is prompted to input the length of password they desire (between 8-128 characters).
  * The user is asked if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters in their password. 

When all prompts are answered the generated password is displayed in the box.
